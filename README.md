# Sample Plugin
Author: **Vector 35 Inc**

_This is a short description meant to fit on one line._

## Description:
This is a longer description meant for a sample plugin that demonstrates the metadata format for Binary Ninja plugins. Note that the [community-plugins repo](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins) contains a useful [utility](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins/blob/master/generate_plugininfo.py) to validate the plugin.json. Additionally, the [release helper](https://github.com/Vector35/release_helper) plugin is helpful for more easily pushing new releases, incrementing versions, and creating the appropriate GitHub tags.

Note that originally we recommended specifying the contents of this entire file inside of the [plugin.json](./plugin.json) but the latest repository generator will use the readme contents directly which means you should simply leave an empty longdescription field. 

## License

This plugin is released under an [MIT license](./license).
